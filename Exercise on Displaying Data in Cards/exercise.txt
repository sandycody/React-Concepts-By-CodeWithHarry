We have to use an API and display the data in the form of a card under a container. All the data points returned by the API should be converted to a card

We can use the API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Hint: 

1. Create a state for the data which will be fetched using the jsonplaceholder API

2. Inside useEffect hook, use fetch API to populate that state and then use map to render the cards from that state.
